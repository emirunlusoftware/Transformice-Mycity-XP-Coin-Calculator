``4) ...Coin Calculator...``

• This program converts your statistics into money according to certain standards and calculates money you can have.

• It makes three different calculation methods and display three different results: Minimum, Average, Maximum (Suspect Mode)

> Minimum: Minimum money amount the player can have
>
> Average: Average money amount the player can have [it's approximate value, may not be 100% accurate]
>
> Maximum (Suspect Mode): Maximum money amount the player can have

• "Maximum" method can be used to find the players that use money hack because they generally don't pay attention when hacking their money.

• Just enter the statistics of the player in order. If "Maximum" result is smaller than the player's real money, you can consider this person boosted its money by using a hack.
