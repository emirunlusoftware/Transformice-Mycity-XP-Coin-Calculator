There are four type calculators in this software:

``1) ...Find My Total Xp...``

• This shows you how many XP you've got so far.

• Enter your level and XP you've collected at your current level to find this.

``2) ...Forward/Backward-looking Level Calculation...``

• Shows you what level you will be by adding/substracting XP.

• Enter your level and XP you've collected at your current level again and additionaly enter how many XP you'll get in the future.

• Also if you want to go back and find your previous level at past, just add the minus sign at the start of the XP value which you'll get in the future.

``3) ...Difference Between Two Levels...``

• Finds the difference of XP values between two players which have different levels.

• For example, you can find XP difference between level 90 and level 10.

• Just enter the two players' level and XP's that they've collected at their current level.

``4) ...Coin Calculator...``

• This program converts your statistics into money according to certain standards and calculates money you can have.

• It makes three different calculation methods and display three different results: Minimum, Average, Maximum (Suspect Mode)

> Minimum: Minimum money amount the player can have
>
> Average: Average money amount the player can have [it's approximate value, may not be 100% accurate]
>
> Maximum (Suspect Mode): Maximum money amount the player can have

• "Maximum" method can be used to find the players that use money hack because they generally don't pay attention when hacking their money.

• Just enter the statistics of the player in order. If "Maximum" result is smaller than the player's real money, you can consider this person boosted its money by using a hack.
